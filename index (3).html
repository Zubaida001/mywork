        Dear, <br />
        <br />
        Daily Mail Manager <br/> 
        <br />

        With Regards,
        <br /><br /><br />
        Herewith I send an application letter and curriculum vitae in response
        to your advertisement in the daily Times, Sunday, 15 May 2011 <br />
        <br />
        I have had experience over the past five years as marketing manager of
        cosmetics and hair care products at. Surya Ayu cosmetics, Washington. In
        that position I'm responsible for sales in the Washington area, San
        Antonio, Denver, Dallas. <br />
        <br />
        I realize that your resume or curriculum vitae that I submit this can
        not explain my qualifications in depth. Therefore, I really hope there
        is a chance interview, which I can explain how the potential in me and
        my ministry will be a tremendous asset for PT's Daily Mail.
        <br /><br /><br />
